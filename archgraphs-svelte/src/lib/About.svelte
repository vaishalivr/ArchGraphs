  Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959) was an American architect known for “organic
  architecture,” designing buildings that harmonize with their surroundings.
  Over a 70-year career, he created more than 1,000 structures, including
  Fallingwater, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Prairie-style homes that
  emphasized open plans and horizontal lines.
